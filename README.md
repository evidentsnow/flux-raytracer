# Flux Raytracer

Physically Based Rendering involves using principles of physics to model the interactions between light and matter.
This is often done to try acheive a photorealistic looking result.

Flux Raytracer is a project which attempts to implement this from first principles, in the Rust programming language

# Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by [pbrt](https://pbrt.org/). It's where I learned about the core concepts of ray tracing, as well as how
we apply linear algebra and vector calculus to create a raytracer.
